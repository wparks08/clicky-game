# Clicky-Game

Clicky-Game is a memory style game. The game is simple: 16 images appear on the screen, allowing you to click on them. Click an image, your score goes up, and the images shuffle around. Click the same image twice, and the game is over.

## Organization

This app is built using React only. There is no back-end to drive any data - the game is managed purely through state and state changes.
